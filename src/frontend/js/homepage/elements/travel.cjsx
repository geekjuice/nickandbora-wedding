Just mention the <em>Hwang and Lee Wedding</em> to apply the discount. Rememeber that it's a first come, first serve rate, so donâ€™t wait too long to book a room.

              Prefer the beach? Then consider the <a href='http://www.hotelindigo.com/hotels/us/en/del-mar/sandm/hoteldetail?qAdlt=1&qBrs=6c.hi.ex.rs.ic.cp.in.sb.cw.cv.ul.vn&qChld=0&qFRA=1&qGRM=0&qPSt=0&qRRSrt=rt&qRef=df&qRms=1&qRpn=1&qRpp=12&qSHp=1&qSmP=3&qSrt=sBR&qWch=0&srb_u=1&icdv=99504425&siclientid=1933&sitrackingid=428058627&dp=true&icdv=99504425' target='_blank'>Hotel Indigo San Diego Del Mar</a>. It's actually minutes away from our first date location at <a href='http://doublehappiness-delmar.com/' target='_blank'>The Double Happiness</a>! And luckily enough, they are also offering a special rate if you mention the <em>Hwang and Lee Wedding</em>. It's about a 10 minute Uber ride from the resort, but it's definietely worth it and right on the beach!

          <p>Remember that booking early means you will have better rates. If you are unsure about the travel, consider booking directly with the hotel as they have flexible (48 hours - 7 days prior) cancellation policies.</p>

          <p>San Diego spring weather is typically mild <a href='http://forecast.io/#/f/32.7157,-117.1617/1396033200' target='_blank'>(60s - 70s)</a>, but could get chilly once the sun goes down. The ceremony will be outside and the reception will be inside, but be sure to bring a sweater or light jacket just in case.</p>

          <p>Also, San Diego is not blessed with public transportation. Keep that in mind when you need to get around. A few options we recommend are <a href='http://uber.com' target='_blank'>Uber</a>, <a href='http://lyft.com'>Lyft</a>, or <a href='http://zipcar.com' target='_blank'>Zipcar</a>.</p>
